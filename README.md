**System Information & Service Monitoring** 
(**SISM**) typically refers to a system or tool used to monitor and manage various aspects of IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, services, and networks. It helps in tracking system performance, availability, and ensuring that services are running optimally.

**Key Components of a SISM Tool:**

**System Monitoring:**
CPU, Memory, Disk Usage: Monitoring system resource usage to identify potential bottlenecks or failures.
Network Monitoring: Tracking network traffic, bandwidth usage, and detecting any anomalies or outages.
Service Monitoring: Checking the status of critical services (e.g., web servers, databases) to ensure they are running as expected.

**Alerting and Notifications:**
Configuring alerts for critical issues (e.g., high CPU usage, service downtime) to notify the relevant teams immediately.
Integrating with various communication tools (email, SMS, Slack) for real-time alerts.

**Logging and Reporting:**
Collecting and analyzing logs from different systems to identify issues or trends.
Generating reports on system performance, uptime, and other key metrics.

**Dashboard:**
Providing a centralized view of all monitored systems and services with visualizations like graphs, charts, and status indicators.
Customizable dashboards to focus on the most critical aspects of the infrastructure.

**Automation:**
Automating routine tasks like restarting services, running scripts, or scaling resources based on predefined triggers.

**Integration:**
Integrating with other IT management tools (e.g., ticketing systems, CMDBs) for a more cohesive management experience.
